# The Random Name Generator


### Acknowledgements ###
The initial code for this idea came from the excellent book, <b>Impractical Python Projects</b> by <i>Lee Vaughan</i>; available at No Starch Press <a href="http://nostarchpress.com">Website</a>.

### Description ###

So - it makes a random name, using standard python packages. This was done in python 3.8.1 in VS Code on my Mac. 

### Purpose ###
1) Increase my generalized python knowledge
2) Refamiliarize myself with Git workflows
3) Publish a public repo and continue to release updates

### How to Run ###
Clone Repository locally

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Intelrunner/python-random.git
$ cd /python-random
$ python app.py
```
<b><i>gasp in wonder at the results</i></b>


## Issues === Feature Requests ##

* Please use the 'issues' section as a feature request construct. AND - If you want to submit a feature request , I would love you for life. 
* Please keep it in the vein of "generating a  X for a X" - and what you might want to do with that value or identifier. This can include making me throw the data into something else, integrate a database, pull in a public API etc. I am just looking for things to do that keep me plugging away using this script as a launch pad.

### Needs ###

* I am looking for a code guru / mentor I can communicate with on some of the 'that's a stupid question' kind of stuff.

* I ama fledgling programmer who works day-to-day in cloud infrastructure; but is really trying to understand the entire software delivery and creation process. As such, most of my code is at the 100 level. But, that is where we all start(ed), no?
